Since the missing weights file is too big for GitHub (206 MB), it can be downloaded from this Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/124SSSGpaEwxRb3CvM4jjYuVyqKaXZHOh/view?usp=sharing

Please put the downloaded file into the ./Output folder if you need to run the code using the pretrained weights ("pretrained = True").
